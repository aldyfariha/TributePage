			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>Romance Dawn Arc</b> - Influenced by Shanks, Luffy starts his journey to become the Pirate King by finding a treasure hidden by the previous Pirate King Gold Roger. At the beginning of his journey, he battles pirate captain Alvida and frees her cabin boy Koby, who wants to become a Marine. Luffy and Koby reach Shells Town, where they meet corrupt Marine captain Axe-Hand Morgan, his son Helmeppo, and the pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Orange Town Arc</b> - Luffy and his first crew member Zoro arrive at Orange Town where they meet a thief named Nami, who hates pirates. The trio makes an unlikely team, fighting to free the town from the rule of Buggy the Clown.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Syrup Village Arc</b> - After Nami forms a partnership with the two as their navigator, the crew reaches Syrup Village and searches for a ship to use. There, they encounter a chronic liar named Usopp. When a devious plot is revealed, Usopp's courage is put to the test as the crew prepare for a battle with the Black Cat Pirates.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Baratie Arc</b> - Usopp joins the crew as a sniper. In search of a cook for their ship, the crew go to a sea restaurant known as the Baratie. However, the restaurant is attacked by the powerful Don Krieg, who has returned from the Grand Line after being attacked by Dracule Mihawk, and wants to use the Baratie as a vessel to go back.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Arlong Park Arc</b> - With Sanji from the Baratie joining the crew and Nami stealing the ship, the crew follow her to an island under the control of the fish-man pirate Arlong. Nami reveals that she is a member of the Arlong Pirates and simply helped the crew so she could take their gold later. But why would she follow a man like Arlong?</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Loguetown Arc</b> - After Nami officially joins, the crew heads to the last town before the entrance to the Grand Line, Loguetown, the place where Gold Roger was both born and executed. Not only will they have to deal with a powerful Marine captain and his second-in-command who reminds Zoro of his past, but also previous enemies looking for revenge.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Alabasta Arc</b> - The crew, with Kureha's assistant Tony Tony Chopper among them, finally arrive at Arabasta, which is on the verge of civil war. Vivi must reach the rebels and tell them the real cause behind the conflict, but Crocodile, leader of Baroque Works and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, will not just stand by and watch. In the end, Baroque Works, marine forces, pirates, the royal guards, and the rebel army clash in a battle that will determine the fate of the country itself.

</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Sky Island Arc</b> - Riding the Knock Up Stream, the crew finds themselves in the "White Sea", an ocean in the sky. The Straw Hats soon discover that there is a war between the Sky People and the natives who originally inhabited a place known as the Upper Yard. They also learn of the cruel God Enel.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Water 7 Arc</b> - In search of a shipwright to join the crew, the Straw Hats land at the thriving metropolis of Water 7. Here, the crew falls apart as two members leave. To make matters worse, the shipwrights are unable to repair the Straw Hats' ship, their money is stolen by thugs, and they are framed for the attempted assassination of Water 7's mayor, who is also president of the Galley-La Company, a shipbuilding company. They try to find the real culprit, but they soon learn that they may have been caught head over heels by the government assassination group CP9.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Thriller Bark Arc</b> - The Straw Hats, now including Franky and the members who previously left, continue their adventure out into the Florian Triangle where they come across a strange barrel which upon opening, sets off a flare. This soon turns into a nightmare when a ghost ship directs them to the haunted island of Thriller Bark, where ghosts, zombies and Warlord of the Sea Gecko Moria await them.<br>
					</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Sabaody Archipelago Arc</b> - Arriving at the Red Line, the crew, now joined by skeleton musician Brook, searches for a way to get to the famed Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats are soon diverted from their search when a mermaid and a talking starfish appear, and they soon find themselves saving an old enemy from a kidnapping ring. Things take a turn for the worst when the Straw Hats find themselves cornered at every turn with a Warlord of the Sea, a Marine admiral and World Government officials.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Amazon Lily Arc</b> - Kuma sends each of the Straw Hat Pirates flying from the Sabaody Archipelago to different islands. This arc centers on Luffy, who lands on an island where only women live. Luffy soon discovers that the women on the island are led by Warlord of the Sea Boa Hancock.</li>
